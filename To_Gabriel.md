## Dear Gabriel
Hope you are having fun in your farm

This is a little document for me to keep track of my steps and progress.
Normally I would let this be in a private document but since you are taking care of so many mountain goats I think it will help
you understand my process better (maybe even have some constructive tips to improve it).

## First read

So I took a look at the readme and the project and what I gathered these things

* A post api that receives a list of json commands (for batch reception) 
* We need a java class to "map" the command 
* Each command logic will be done in a separate function to ensure the simplicity of other commands
* CQRS pattern? 
* DaoInMemory in a map noted
* Test coverage is at 100% class 
* Good to consider adding mutation tests to ensure we keep that percentage 
* Gabriel did such a great job
